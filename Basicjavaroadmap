## Introduction
Java is a versatile and powerful programming language used across various domains, from web and mobile applications to enterprise systems. Its platform-independent nature makes it a popular choice among developers.

## Setting Up Your Environment
Before diving into Java, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Install JDK**: Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. **Set Up IDE**: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
3. **Verify Installation**: Open your terminal/command prompt and run `java -version` and `javac -version` to ensure Java is installed correctly.

## Java Syntax Basics
Understanding the basic syntax of Java is crucial for writing your first programs. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Variables and Data Types
Java supports various data types and variables that store data values. Here's a quick overview:

- **Primitive Data Types**: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char
- **Non-Primitive Data Types**: String, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces

Example:
```java
int age = 25;
double price = 19.99;
char grade = 'A';
boolean isJavaFun = true;
```

## Control Flow Statements
Control flow statements determine the order in which statements are executed. Common examples include:

- **Conditional Statements**: if, if-else, switch
- **Loops**: for, while, do-while

Example:
```java
if (age > 18) {
    System.out.println("Adult");
} else {
    System.out.println("Not an Adult");
}

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

## Object-Oriented Programming
Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Key OOP concepts include:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**

Example:
```java
public class Dog {
    String breed;
    int age;

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

## Exception Handling
Exception handling in Java allows you to manage runtime errors and maintain the normal flow of the program using try, catch, and finally blocks.

Example:
```java
try {
    int division = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This block always executes");
}
```
